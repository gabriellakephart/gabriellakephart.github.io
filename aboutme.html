         Hi, my name is Gabriella but I prefer to be called Gaby. In my family I am the oldest and I am the only girl too. I have two younger brothers named Guy and Johnny. My family and I live in San Bruno, and we all go to school in Millbrae. I go to Mills High school and I am going into the 10th grade. My favorite subject in school is choir because I like to sing and it is a fun class with a cool teacher. I like music a lot but I don't have a favorite song or artist because there are just too many out there that I really like. This summer the day after SMASH ends, August 5th, is my birthay and I will be turning 15. I really like food and drinks, especially when they are healthy like smoothies because I really think it is important to take care of yourself and your body.
